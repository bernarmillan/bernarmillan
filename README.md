    - Dart and Flutter for mobile app development

    - I also have knowledge of Python

- 🌐 I'm especially interested in mobile development and everything related to computing and modern tech.

- 🤝 I'm open to collaborating on open source or personal projects where I can keep learning and contribute with the skills I already have.
